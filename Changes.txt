Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::MSAccess::Convert2Db.

1.05  Thu Oct 27 19:40:00 2005
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
		which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.04  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.03  Fri Apr 16 11:09:36 2004
	- There are no code changes in this version
	- Stop shipping Makefile.PL. Encourage users to install Module::Build, and to
		then install this module via the mantra:
			perl Build.PL
			perl Build
			perl Build test
			perl Build install
		Thanx to Mike Castle for reporting an error with Makefile.PL
	- Fix a cut-and-paste error in the POD where DBIx::MSAccess::Convert2Db had the
		last colon missing in 7 lines. Thanx to Mike Castle for reporting this

1.02  Wed Apr  7 11:46:41 2004
	- Recent changes to DBIx::SQLEngine resulted in the following SQL being generated to
		determine the names of the columns in the Access database:
			select * from `$table_name` limit 1
		but the limit clause does not work with Access. I have replaced that SQL with:
			select top 1 * from `$table_name`
	- To build this module, you will now need Module::Build

1.01  Wed Jan 21 13:48:00 2004
	- Change handing of verbose option to only save log if verbose is true

1.00  Tue Jan 20 12:37:29 2004
	- Original version
