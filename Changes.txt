Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::MSAccess:Convert2Db.

1.02  Wed Apr  7 11:46:41 2004
	- Recent changes to DBIx::SQLEngine resulted in the following SQL being generated to
		determine the names of the columns in the Access database:
			select * from `$table_name` limit 1
		but the limit clause does not work with Access. I have replaced that SQL with:
			select top 1 * from `$table_name`
	- To build this module, you will now need Module::Build

1.01  Wed Jan 21 13:48:00 2004

1.00  Tue Jan 20 12:37:29 2004
