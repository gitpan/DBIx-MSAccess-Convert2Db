[V 1.05]
Date=2005-10-27T19:40:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
as per the new standard on such matters
- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}'
which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file
which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

Comments= <<EOT
- There are no code changes in this version
- Stop shipping Makefile.PL. Encourage users to install Module::Build and to
then install this module via the mantra:
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
perl Build install
Thanx to Mike Castle for reporting an error with Makefile.PL
- Fix a cut-and-paste error in the POD where DBIx::MSAccess::Convert2Db had the
last colon missing in 7 lines. Thanx to Mike Castle for reporting this
EOT

[V 1.02]
Date=2004-04-07T11:46:41
Comments= <<EOT
- Recent changes to DBIx::SQLEngine resulted in the following SQL being generated to
determine the names of the columns in the Access database:
select * from `$table_name` limit 1
but the limit clause does not work with Access. I have replaced that SQL with:
select top 1 * from `$table_name`
- To build this module you will now need Module::Build
